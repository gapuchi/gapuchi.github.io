This is my first blog post! I decided to make a blog for any thoughts I come across (probably programming related). This blog is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I haven't used Jekyll before, so this first post also serves as a test to see it in action.

Thanks to [agusmakmun](https://github.com/agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io) for providing an open source Jekyll theme which I forked for my personal use.

I always had trouble understanding all the tools/platforms/frameworks/etc that goes into a project and how each actually contributes in making the final product. When I was attempting to create a GitHub Page with Jekyll, I had the same issue. I understood GitHub Pages and how it hosts my content to be displayed, but I didn't understand how to integrate Jekyll with GitHub. So, as a note for myself, this blog was created with:

* Jekyll, a static website generator that creates a website by converting files (markdown, html, js, css, etc) that is organized in a specific [structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).
* GitHub Pages, which hosts all my content. It **automatically build the website with Jekyll** if the files structure matches the defined Jekyll structure. This wasn't clear in the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) to me, so it took me some time to figure that out.
