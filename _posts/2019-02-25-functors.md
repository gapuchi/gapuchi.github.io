# Functors

In layman's terms, a functor is anything with a `map` function. The `map` can be thought as a means to change all values in a structure, without changing the structure.

```scala
List(1, 2, 3).map(n => n + 1)
// res0: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)

Some(1).map(n => n * 2)
// res1: Option[Int] = Some(2)

Option.empty[Int].map(n => n * 2)
// res2: Option[Int] = None
```

Because it doesn't change, we can chain calls

```scala
Right(12)
    .map(n => n + 1)
    .map(n => n + 1)
    .map(n => n + 1)
    .map(n => n * 3)
    .map(n => n - 4)
// res3: scala.util.Either[Nothing,Int] = Right(41)
```

`List`, `Option`, `Either` all have eager evaluations. But `map` doesn't have to be. All it is a mean to sequence of operations.

## Example: Futures

`Future` is a functor that sequences asynchronous computations, by executing each one as the previous one completes.

```scala
import scala.concurrent.{Future, Await}
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val future: Future[String] =
  Future(123).
    map(n => n + 1).
    map(n => n * 2).
    map(n => n + "!")

Await.result(future, 1.second)
// res3: String = 248!
```

**Note:** Future aren't referentially transparent. They are computed and results are cached. This gives us non functional behavior when wrapping side effects in `Future`'s.

```scala
import scala.concurrent.{Future, Await}
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.util.Random

val future1 = {
  val r = new Random(0L)

  val x = Future(r.nextInt) //nextInt is a side effect

  for {
    a <- x
    b <- x
  } yield (a, b)
}

//should be the same as

val future2 = {
  val r = new Random(0L)

  for {
    a <- Future(r.nextInt) //Replaced x with its value
    b <- Future(r.nextInt)
  } yield (a, b)
}

val result1 = Await.result(future1, 1.second)
// result1: (Int, Int) = (-1155484576,-1155484576)

val result2 = Await.result(future2, 1.second)
// result2: (Int, Int) = (-1155484576,-723955400)
```

## Definition of a Functor

A **functor** is a type `F[A]` that has a `map` operation of the type of `(A => B) => F[B]`.
